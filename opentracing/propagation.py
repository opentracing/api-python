    NOTE: The TEXT_MAP carrier dict may contain unrelated data (e.g.,

    The HTTP_HEADERS format represents SpanContexts in a python dict mapping

    HTTP headers (without modification or further escaping). That is, the
    keys have a greatly restricted character set, casing for the keys may not
    be preserved by various intermediaries, and the values should be
    URL-escaped.
